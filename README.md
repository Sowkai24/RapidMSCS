# RapidMSCS
Get a minecraft server on your RPI faster than anything.(This statement is prob. outdated)
Preconfiguerd Minecraft Java server utilizing MSCS. Easier than tedious typing.
This OS is just the installation script.
I don't own MSCS, so please check out https://minecraftservercontrol.github.io/docs/mscs (and don't ban hammer me!)
If you post an issue here, I'll just post a link to their troubleshooting guide. If you still have an issue, open a ticket on their Github: https://github.com/MinecraftServerControl/mscs/issues
